\section{Conclusion} 
In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for joint depth and normal estimation via edge-aware depth and normal consistency. Our novel depth-normal regularization enforces the geoemetry consistency between different projections of the 3D scene, improving evaluation performances and also the training speed.
We present ablation experiments exploring each component of our framework and also on different scenes of images. Our results are comparable to some supervised methods, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised monocular methods.

\paragraph{Future work.}
In future work, we will not be limited to unsupervised learning, while being able to stick in supervised training of joint normal and depth prediction for cross supervision, \eg using normal ground truth to regularize estimated depth.

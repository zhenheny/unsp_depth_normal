\section{Conclusion} 
In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for both depth and normal estimation via edge-aware depth-normal consistency. Our novel depth-normal regularization enforces the geoemetry consistency between different projections of the 3D scene, improving evaluation performances and also the training speed.
We present ablation experiments exploring each component of our framework and also on different scenes of images. Our results are even better than some supervised methods, and achieve state-of-the-art performance when only using monocular videos.

In the future, we would like to stick the consistency in supervised learning of both normal and depth predictions for cross supervision, which hopefully could also provides additional improvements.

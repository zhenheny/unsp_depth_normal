\section{Conclusion} 
In this paper, we propose a joint unsupervised learning, 

\paragraph{Future work.}
Our strategy is not limited to unsupervised learning, while being able to stick in supervised training of joint normal and depth prediction for cross supervision, \eg using normal ground truth to regularize estimated depth.
